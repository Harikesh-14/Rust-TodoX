# Rust TodoX


Rust Todo List App is a command-line tool written in Rust that allows users to manage their tasks efficiently. Whether you need to add, mark as done, edit, or clear tasks from your todo list, this app provides essential functionalities to streamline your task management process. Additionally, I have integrated sqlite3 using the `rusqlite` crate. The database stores the data and will persist indefinitely until you manually delete it.

## Features
- **List tasks:** Display all tasks in the todo list.
- **Add task:** Add a new task to the todo list.
- **Complete task:** Mark a task as completed.
- **Edit task:** Modify an existing task.
- **Clear list:** Clear the todo list at once.
